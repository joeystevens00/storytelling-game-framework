# Storytelling game framework  
A small framework for developing a storytelling game.  

## Designing a game  
The game is made up of scenes which are defined in JSON. A scene has an image, some text, and some options. Each option contains the scene that will be loaded as a result of the selection. An example scene would look like:    
```
{
  "scene": 4,
  "image": "image-03.jpeg",
  "text": "There is a fork in the road which way do you go?",
  "mode": "non-linear",
  "options":
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "option": "Go left (Dangerous)",
      "scene": 5
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "option": "Go right (Safe)",
      "scene": 6
    }
  ]
}
```  

## Modes  
Each scene can have a mode. A mode defines how the scene is displayed:  
*non-linear*: Expects options to exist and will wait for a selection.  
*auto*: Displays the text and waits for the config.wait setting (default 2000ms).  
*linear*: Displays the text and will wait for a the next scene button to be pressed.
See data/scene.json for more details  

## config
Inside of scene.json can be a config that is defined with the following properties:
*wait*: Defines the wait time in ms of the auto mode.
*mode*: Defines the starting/default mode. Note: Once a mode is set in a scene this is not used so it's best practice to not rely on this unless the entire game is in single mode.
```
"config":
{
    "mode": "non-linear",
    "wait": 2000
}
```  
See data/scene.json for more details
